Peer-to-peer office network simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer

# Peer-to-Peer Office Network — Cisco Packet Tracer
A simulated inter-office network connecting two branch offices using a single router, built and tested in Cisco Packet Tracer.

# Project Overview
This project demonstrates a basic peer-to-peer office network where two offices which are Administrative Office and IT office with different IP addressing schemes communicate through a centrally connected router. It covers core networking concepts including IP addressing, subnetting, inter-LAN routing, and end-to-end connectivity verification.
